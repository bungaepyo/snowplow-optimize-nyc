# snowplow-optimize-nyc

This is a data-analytics/optimization project using Gurobi and KMeans clustering.

### Problem Statement
---
During winter times, it is the government’s duty to keep the streets clean and safe by removing snow.
Snow plowing service is directly related to the city's safety, sanity, and the transportation network.
If the government’s snow removal strategy fails, it can hugely affect the urban productivity and security.
Therefore, the city government must be able to optimally prepare against annual snow storms.

Plowing trucks play a huge role in this overall issue because they are on the frontier, physically removing
snow and spraying salt. Thus, the question I want to answer is “where should the government primarily locate its plowing trucks?”
